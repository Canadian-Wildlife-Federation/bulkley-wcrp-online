    "text": "Plan Purpose, Approach, and Scope\nThe following Watershed Connectivity Restoration Plan (WCRP) represents the culmination of a one-year collaborative planning effort for the Bulkley River watershed (excluding the Morice River, see Geographic Scope), the overall aim of which is to clarify and reduce the threat of aquatic barriers to anadromous salmonids and the livelihoods that they support, including the values and laws of First Nations, as well their continued sustenance, cultural, and ceremonial needs both now and into the future. This 10-year plan was developed to identify priority actions that the Bulkley River WCRP planning team (see Table 1 for a list of team members) will undertake between 2021-2031 to conserve and restore fish passage in the watershed through strategies aimed at barrier rehabilitation, barrier prevention, and strengthening Indigenous connections to land and water.\nWCRPs are long-term, actionable plans that blend local stakeholder and rightsholder knowledge with innovative GIS analyses to gain a shared understanding of where restoration efforts will have the greatest benefit for anadromous salmonids. The planning process is inspired by the Conservation Standards (v.4.0), which is a conservation planning framework that allows planning teams to systematically identify, implement, and monitor strategies to apply the most effective solutions to high priority conservation problems. There is a rich history of connectivity and fish passage planning and restoration work in the Bulkley River watershed that this WCRP builds upon, including the work undertaken by the BC Fish Passage Technical Working Group, the Skeena Fisheries Commission, the Office of the Wet’suwet’en, the Wet’suwet’en First Nation, and the Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern British Columbia (SERNbc) among others (Wilson and Rabnet. (2007), McCarthy and Fernando (2015), Smith (2018), Casselman and Stanley (2010), Irvine (2018)). The Canadian Wildlife Federation will continue to engage and coordinate with local partners and existing initiatives, in part through the Skeena Environmental Stewardship Initiative. SERNbc is also currently undertaking undertaking fish passage work in the Bulkley River watershed, with some overlap and some differences in scope compared to the work and processes described in this WCRP. The SERNbc project relies on expert knowledge and field assessments in both the Bulkley and Morice watersheds to improve passage for all fish, including fluvial and resident species, and focuses on stream crossings that act as barriers (Irvine (2021)). This WCRP focuses specifically on improving connectivity for anadromous salmonid species and uses consensus-based planning exercises and spatial model implementation to develop watershed-scale status assessments, goal setting, and prioritization for multiple structure types. SERNbc and the WCRP planning team are currently collaborating on the development of the bcfishpass connectivity model and will continue to work together to promote coordination and collaboration between the two initiatives moving forward.\nThe planning team compiled existing structure location and assessment data, habitat data, and previously identified priorities, and combined this with local and Indigenous knowledge to create a strategic watershed-scale plan to improve connectivity. To expand on this work, the Bulkley River WCRP planning team applied the WCRP planning framework to define the “thematic” scope of freshwater connectivity and refine the “geographic” scope to identify those portions of the watershed where structure prioritization will be conducted, and subsequent remediation efforts will take place. Additionally, the team selected focal fish species, assessed their current connectivity status in the watershed, defined concrete goals for gains in connectivity, and developed a priority list of structures for rehabilitation to achieve those goals. During the 2021 field season, 28 structure assessments and 21 habitat confirmations were completed. Seventeen barriers were added to the intermediate barrier list based on 2021 field assessments, and an additional 17 structures were removed from the list, due to being passable, not existing, or having low quality habitat (see Table 5). The preliminary barriers list was further divided this year into an “intermediate barriers” list (see Table 6), which includes barriers that require further assessment, and a “priority barriers” list (see Table 7), which includes barriers that are actively being pursued for design and rehabilitation. While the current version of this plan is based on the best-available information at the time of publishing, WCRPs are intended to be “living plans” that are updated regularly as new information becomes available, or if local priorities and contexts change. As such, this document should be interpreted as a current “snap-shot” in time, and future iterations of this WCRP will build upon the material presented in this plan to continuously improve aquatic barrier rehabilitation for migratory fish in the Bulkley River watershed. For more information on how WCRPs are developed, see Mazany-Wright, Noseworthy, et al. (2021).",

    "section": "Project Scope",
    "text": "Project Scope\nConnectivity is a critical component of freshwater ecosystems that encompasses a variety of factors related to ecosystem structure and function, such as the ability of aquatic organisms to disperse and/or migrate, the transportation of energy and matter (e.g., nutrient cycling and sediment flows), and temperature regulation (Seliger and Zeiringer (2018).). Though each of these factors are important when considering the health of a watershed, for the purposes of this WCRP the term “freshwater connectivity” is defined as the degree to which aquatic organisms can disperse and/or migrate freely through freshwater systems. Within this context, freshwater connectivity is primarily constrained by physical structures including anthropogenic infrastructure such as dams, weirs, and stream crossings, and natural barriers such as waterfalls and debris flows. This plan is intended to focus on the direct restoration and prevention of localized, physical structures instead of the broad land-use patterns that are causing chronic connectivity issues in the watershed. The planning team decided that the primary focus of this WCRP is addressing barriers to longitudinal connectivity (i.e., along the upstream-downstream plane) due to the magnitude of the threat posed by linear development (i.e., road and rail lines) in the watershed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The primary geographic scope — the Bulkley River watershed, excluding the Morice River drainage.\n\n\n\nThe primary geographic scope of this WCRP is the Bulkley River watershed, located in the mid-eastern portion of the Skeena River drainage basin in northwestern British Columbia (Figure 1). The scope constitutes the Bulkley River “watershed group” as defined by the British Columbia Freshwater Atlas (FWA). A consistent spatial framework was necessary to undertake a watershed-selection process at the provincial scale to identify target watersheds to improve connectivity for salmonids. The Bulkley River watershed was identified by the BC Fish Passage Restoration Initiative as one of four target watersheds for WCRP development Mazany-Wright, Norris, et al. (2021b). The Bulkley River watershed has a drainage area of 776,200 ha, spanning from Bulkley Lake in the southeast to the confluence with the Skeena River in the northwest. The watershed is generally divided into the “lower” Bulkley River and the “upper” Bulkley River by the confluence with the Morice River near the town of Houston. Culturally and economically important populations of Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), and Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are all found in the watershed, which historically supported Indigenous sustenance and trading economies (Table 1; Irvine (2021)).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Focal fish species in the Bulkley River watershed.

Each Wilp has jurisdiction over several Anaat, or fishing sites. The Wilp groups that have territory coinciding with the Bulkley River watershed include Djogaslee, Gyet’m Galdo’o, Luutkudziiwas, Axtii Tsex, Yagosip, and Spookw (G. Sebastian pers. comm.). The Gitxsan steward the land and waters based on Ayookw (Gitxsan law) and Adaakw (oral histories; Government (2019), Irvine (2021)). It is necessary to receive permission from the individual Wilp chief for any work to occur on their territory.\nWet’suwet’en peoples– the Wedzin Kwah (Bulkley River watershed) is part of the larger Wet’suwet’en traditional territory. The hereditary territory is governed by a system made up of five clans – Gilseyhu (Big Frog), Laksilyu (Small Frog), Tsayu (Beaver), Gitdumden (Wolf/Bear) and Laksamshu (Fireweed) – each of which comprises multiple Yikhs (House Groups) represented by hereditary chiefs. The Wet’suwet’en steward the land based on Inuk Nu’at’en (Wet’suwet’en law), and the principle of Yintahk, meaning everything is connected to the land (Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013), Irvine (2021)). It is necessary to receive permission from the appropriate bands (Witset First Nation or Wet’suwet’en first Nation, Skin Tyee, Nee Tahi Buhn, or Burns Lake Band), nation representatives (Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013)), and the individual Yikh chiefs for any work to occur on their territory.\n\nThe geographic scope of this WCRP was further refined by identifying “naturally accessible waterbodies”, which are defined as streams that focal species should be able to access in the absence of anthropogenic structures (Figure 2). Naturally accessible waterbodies were spatially delineated using fish species observation and distribution data, as well as data on “exclusionary points”, which are waterfalls greater than 5 m in height and gradient barriers based on species-specific swimming abilities. These maps were explored by the planning team to incorporate additional local knowledge, ensure accuracy, and finalize the constraints on naturally accessible waterbodies. All other waterbodies were removed from the scope for further consideration. The “constrained geographic scope” formed the foundation for all subsequent analyses and planning steps, including mapping and modelling useable habitat types, quantifying the current connectivity status, goal setting, and action planning Mazany-Wright, Norris, et al. (2021a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Naturally accessible waterbodies within the Bulkley River watershed.

    "section": "Focal Species",
    "text": "Focal Species\nFocal species represent the ecologically and culturally important species for which habitat connectivity is being conserved and/or restored in the watershed. In the Bulkley River watershed, the planning team selected Anadromous Salmonids as the focal guild, which comprises Chinook Salmon, Coho Salmon, Sockeye Salmon, and Steelhead. Anadromous salmonids also include Pink Salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and Chum Salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) as beneficiary species (i.e., species that are not actively targeted through the planning process but will also benefit from connectivity improvements for target anadromous species in the watershed). The selection of these focal species was driven primarily by the focal species of the primary fund supporting this planning work. The planning team also identified other culturally and ecologically important species within the watershed to consider for inclusion in future iterations of the WCRP, including Pacific Lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) and Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus).\n\nAnadromous Salmonids\nAnadromous salmonids are cultural and ecological keystone species that contribute to productive ecosystems by contributing marine-derived nutrients to the watershed and forming an important food source for grizzly bears and other species Schindler and Quay (2003). Salmon have enduring food, social, and ceremonial value for the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en peoples and contribute significant economic value for recreational and commercial fisheries. Salmon have sustained the culture and economies of Indigenous peoples in the watershed since time immemorial – providing the primary food source for communities, supporting wide-ranging trade systems, and helping pass knowledge and ceremony to future generations through fishing and fish processing (SSAF (2021), Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013), Rescan (2012)).\nAnadromous salmonid populations in the Bulkley River watershed have declined significantly in recent decades, leading both the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en nations to declare harvest moratoriums or fishing bans in their territories (Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013), Government (2019)). The stewardship of these resources in their territories are imbued in the spirit and culture of these nations through a symbiotic relationship with these fish species – threats to the fish are threats to the well-being of the Wet’suwet’en and Gitxsan peoples (SSAF (2021)). The stewardship of their waters continues through the work of the Gitksan Watershed Authorities and the Wet’suwet’en Fisheries Program, as well as collaborative initiatives like the Skeena Environment Stewardship Initiative.\nFor the purposes of this WCRP, anadromous salmonid populations are defined using Fisheries and Oceans Canada’s Conservation Units. A Conservation Unit (CU) is a group of wild Pacific salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations. Conservation Units are not defined for Steelhead, as such there is no assessment information to provide for the Bulkley River watershed population. See Appendix A for maps of modelled anadromous salmonid spawning and rearing habitat in the Bulkley River watershed.\n\n\nChinook Salmon | Ya’aa | Ggïs| Oncorhynchus tshawytscha\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Chinook Salmon Conservation Units assessments in the Bulkley River watershed.

The Middle Skeena Chinook Salmon stocks have seen a decline in recent years, particularly over the last three generations of spawners Pacific Salmon Explorer. The upper Bulkley River Chinook Salmon (upstream of the confluence with the Morice River) are the first salmon to return in the year, usually early-to-mid June, marking the start of the salmon fishery in the watershed Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013). The upper Bulkley River population is known to spawn in the mainstem and tributaries of the Bulkley River, including Buck Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Maxan Creek, and Foxy Creek. In some years, low water flows prevent adult Chinook Salmon from migrating past Bulkley Falls. The upper Bulkley Chinook Salmon stocks have been observed to be in decline and are threatened, in part, by habitat degradation, including linear development (e.g., highway, rail, and road infrastructure) that fragments tributaries (Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013), Pacific Salmon Explorer).\n\n\nCoho Salmon | Eek | Deedzex | Oncorhynchus kisutch\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Coho Salmon Conservation Unit assessment in the Bulkley River Watershed.

Coho Salmon spawning migration peaks in early-to-mid August, though traditionally the main Coho Salmon fishery occurs later in the season (Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013)). Spawning and rearing of the Middle Skeena population is known to occur within the watershed in the mainstem channels of the Bulkley, Telkwa, and Suskwa Rivers, and key tributaries, including Buck Creek, Aitken Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Ailport Creek, and Maxan Creek. In recent decades, Coho Salmon distribution has often been limited to areas downstream of Bulkley Falls, but in years with sufficient flow, tributaries upstream of the falls are well-used by rearing juveniles (M. Risdale pers. comm.). The Coho Salmon population in the watershed appeared to begin recovering around 1998 but has since declined over the last three generations of spawners (Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013), PSF 2014). Additionally, since 1989, tens of thousands of Coho Salmon fry have been released into the upper Bulkley River mainstem from the Toboggan Hatchery on Toboggan Creek (Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013)).\n\n\nSockeye Salmon | Mi’soo | Taalook | Oncorhynchus nerka\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Sockeye Salmon Conservation Unit Assessments in the Bulkley River watershed.

Limitations on the Sockeye Salmon harvest in the watershed have hindered the ability of the Wet’suwet’en and Gitxsan to practice important cultural activities and the associated sharing of oral traditions and histories (SSAF (2021), Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013)). The Sockeye Salmon runs generally follow the spring Chinook Salmon migrations in the Bulkley River system, but Bulkley Falls and flows in some parts of Maxan Creek can limit migration during low-flow years. Data are insufficient for population assessments; however, it is believed that the Bulkley/Maxan populations are at risk of extirpation. There are two Sockeye Salmon populations present in the watershed with distinct life histories – the lake-type and the river-type (Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013), PSF 2014). Two lake-type Sockeye Salmon sub-populations spawn and rear in and around Bulkley Lake and Maxan Lake, and a third lake-type sub-population was extirpated from Toboggan Lake. River-type Sockeye distribution and habitat use within the Bulkley River watershed is not well documented; however, there are records of Sockeye Salmon river spawners in the mainstem Bulkley River around Richfield Creek, McQuarrie Creek, the Morice River confluence, and the Suskwa River mainstem near Natlan Creek.\n\n\nSteelhead | Milit | Tësdlï | Oncorhynchus mykiss\nSteelhead migrations coincide with the arrival of Coho Salmon in the watershed and are an important traditional food source to augment winter stores (Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013)). Steelhead are known to spawn and rear in the mainstem Bulkley River and important tributaries, including the Telkwa River, Hubert Creek, Buck Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Ailport Creek, Johnny David Creek, and Robert Hatch Creek. In the lower part of the watershed, Steelhead are known to spawn and rear throughout the Suskwa River system, all the way up through Harold Price Creek and Blunt Creek. Local knowledge indicates that Steelhead populations have been declining in recent decades and are currently in poor condition throughout the entire watershed. In response, some stocking enhancement actions have been undertaken in an attempt to increase the population in the watershed (Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013), Chudyk (1979)).",

    "text": "Structure Types\nThe following table highlights which structure types pose the greatest threat to anadromous salmon in the watershed. The results of this assessment were used to inform the subsequent planning steps, as well as to identify knowledge gaps where there is little spatial data to inform the assessment for a specific structure type.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Structure Types in the Bulkley River watershed and structure rating assessment results. For each structure type listed, Extent refers to the proportion of anadromous salmonid habitat that is being blocked by that structure type, Severity is the proportion of structures for each structure type that are known to block passage for focal species based on field assessments, and Irreversibility is the degree to which the effects of a structure type can be reversed and connectivity restored. The amount of habitat blocked used in this exercise is a representation of total amount of combined spawning and rearing habitat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure Types\nExtent\nSeverity\nIrreversibility\nOverall Threat Rating:\n\n\n\n\nRoad-Stream Crossings\nHigh\nVery High\nMedium\nHigh\n\n\nRail-stream Crossings\nLow\nLow\nMedium\nHigh\n\n\nNatural Barriers\nMedium\nVery High\nMedium\nMedium\n\n\nLateral Barriers\nMedium\nHigh\nMedium\nMedium\n\n\nLarge Dams(&gt;3m height)\nLow\nVery High\nHigh\nLow\n\n\nSmall Dams(&lt;3m height)\nLow\nVery High\nMedium\nLow\n\n\nTrail-stream Crossings\nMedium\nMedium\nLow\nLow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoad-stream Crossings\nRoad-stream crossings are the most abundant structure type in the watershed, with 48 assessed and modelled crossings located on stream segments with modelled habitat. Demographic road crossings (highways, municipal, and paved roads) block 17.6 of habitat (1% of the total blocked habitat), with 0% of assessed crossings having been identified as barriers to fish passage. Resource roads block 17.6 km of habitat (1%), with 0% of assessed crossings have been identified as barriers. Significant land use and linear development throughout the valley bottom has disconnected the Bulkley River from important habitat in many tributaries, including Highway 16 which represents one of the main drivers of fragmentation in the watershed (see Table 1). The collective experience and input from the planning team resulted in a Medium irreversibility rating due to the technical complexity and resources required to remediate road-stream crossings, though it was noted that this differs considerably between resource roads and highway crossings.\n\n\nRail-stream crossings\nThere are relatively few rail-stream crossings in the watershed (24 crossings on “potentially accessible” streams), but those that exist block significant amounts of habitat (17.6 km or 1% of the total habitat blocked), with more than half of assessed crossings (0%) acting as barriers to anadromous salmonids. All rail-stream crossings in the watershed are associated with the Canadian National (CN) railway running along the Bulkley River. With significant financial costs, technical challenges, and stakeholder engagement required with CN to remediate these barriers, the planning team decided on an overall pressure rating of High for this barrier type.\n\n\nLateral Barriers\nThere are numerous types of lateral barriers that potentially occur in the watershed, including dykes, berms, and linear development (i.e., road and rail lines), all of which can restrict the ability of anadromous salmonids to move into floodplains, riparian wetlands, and other off-channel habitats. No comprehensive lateral barrier data exists within the watershed, so pressure ratings were based on qualitative local knowledge. Lateral barriers are not thought to be as prevalent as road- or rail-stream crossings but are likely very severe where they do exist. Highway 16 and the CN rail line that run along a significant stretch of the Bulkley River were identified as major lateral barriers that disconnect the mainstem river from its historic floodplain and off-channel habitat. Overall, the planning team decided that a Medium pressure rating adequately captured the effect that lateral barriers are having on connectivity in the watershed, while recognizing that the lack of data on lateral barriers in the watershed is an important knowledge gap to fill.\n\n\nNatural Barriers\nNatural barriers to fish passage can include debris flows, log jams, sediment deposits, etc., but natural features that have always restricted fish passage (e.g., waterfalls) are not considered under this barrier type. Natural barriers are difficult to include in a spatial prioritization framework due to their transient nature. The planning team felt that the extent of natural barriers in the watershed is seasonal and fluctuates with freshet flow levels. Both current and historic land-use practices, including historic mining and current forest-harvesting impacts, have created sediment wedges that can act as significant barriers to anadromous salmonids. Due to the nature of these land-use practices, the severity of natural barriers was rated as High and the irreversibility as Medium, the latter due to the nature of what would be required to rectify poor land-use practices at a watershed scale. Overall, the planning team felt that a pressure rating of Medium adequately captured the effects of natural barriers.\n\n\nLarge Dams (&gt;3m height) and Small Dams (&lt;3m height)\nThere are 24 mapped large and small dams on “potentially accessible” stream segments in the watershed, blocking 17.6 km (0.74% of the total blocked habitat) of modelled spawning and rearing habitat, resulting in a Low extent. The extent rating of these structures was confirmed by the planning team. There is only one known fish passage structure in the watershed and the remaining dams likely block passage for anadromous salmonids. Remediating these dams will require significant resources; however, due to the Low extent of dams in the watershed, a final pressure rating of Low was assigned.\n\n\nTrail-stream crossings\nThere is very little spatial data available on trail-stream crossings in the watershed, so the planning team was unable to quantify the true Extent and Severity of this structure type. However, the planning team felt that trail-stream crossings are not prevalent within the watershed and that where they do exist, they rarely significantly block passage for anadromous salmonids. Given that most structures will likely be fords or similar structures, the rehabilitation costs associated with these barriers would be quite low. Overall, the planning team felt that the pressure rating for trail-stream crossings was likely Low.\n\n\n\n\nCasselman, J., and D.

    "text": "Connectivity Status Assessment\nThe planning team identified two Key Ecological Attributes (KEAs) to assess the current connectivity status of the watershed for each focal species – available spawning habitat and available rearing habitat (Table 1). KEAs are the key aspects of anadromous salmon habitat that are being targeted by this WCRP. For each KEA, an associated indicator was assigned to measure the status of that KEA. The connectivity status indicators were used to establish goals to improve key habitat connectivity over time and is the baseline against which progress is tracked over time.\nThe current connectivity status was estimated using three spatial models:\nTable 1: Connectivity status assessment for spawning (a) and rearing (b) habitat in the Bulkley River watershed. The two KEAs - Accessible Spawning Habitat and Accessible Rearing Habitat - are evaluated by dividing the length of linear habitat (of each type) that is currently accessible to focal species by the total length of all linear habitat (of each type) in the watershed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Species\nKEA\nIndicator\nPoor\nFair\nGood\nVery Good\n\n\n\n\nAndromous Salmon\nAvailable Spawning Habitat\n% of total spawning habitat\n&lt;50%\n51-75%\n76-90%\n&gt;90%\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Status:\n\n\n86\nComments: Indicator rating definitions are based on the consensus decisions of the planning team.

    "text": "Accessibility model: Naturally accessible waterbodies are those that are considered likely accessible to focal species if no human-made barriers existed on the landscape. These were spatially delineated for each focal species using natural barriers (i.e., waterfalls, gradient barriers, or subsurface flows) that would naturally limit upstream movement (Table XX).\nHabitat model: A subset of the naturally accessible waterbody layer was defined as key habitat, i.e., habitat likely to support spawning or rearing, rather than simply movement corridors. The habitat model identifies areas within waterbodies that have a higher potential to support key habitat based on stream channel gradient and discharge. The habitat model criteria can be found in (Table XX).\nConnectivity model: A layer of known or modelled structures was overlaid on the key habitat results. Structures with unknown passability were treated as a full barrier until confirmed passable by either local knowledge, desktop review, or field assessment. Watershed connectivity was estimated by calculating the amount of key habitat that is connected to the ocean (i.e., not fragmented by human-made barriers). Key habitat with no structures or only passable structures downstream was considered connected. Key habitat upstream of full, partial, or potential barriers was considered disconnected. All connected habitat was summed and divided by the total amount of key habitat in the watershed to arrive at the KEA indicators. Detailed methods for the connectivity model can be found in Appendix C",

    "text": "Field Assessment Ranking Process\nA primary outcome of the WCRP will be the rehabilitation of barriers to connectivity in the Bulkley River Watershed. To achieve the goals in this plan, it is necessary to identify a suite of barriers that, if rehabilitated, will provide access to a minimum of 86 km of spawning habitat and 211 km of rearing habitat (Table 1):\nTable 1: Spawning and rearing habitat connectivity gain requirements to meet WCRP goals in the Bulkley River watershed. The measures of currently accessible and total habitat values are derived from the Intrinsic Potential habitat model described in Appendix B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabitat Type\nCurrently accessible (km)\nTotal\nCurrent Connectivity Status\nGoal\nGain required (km)\n\n\n\n\nSpawning\n1152.57\n1334.5\n86%\n95%\n549.86\n\n\nRearing\n1543.87\n2208.78\n70%\n80%\n549.86\nAfter all existing data and knowledge are collated for known and modelled crossings, an iterative ranking process is conducted to help confirm barriers to target for rehabilitation to meet the goals. The ranking process is primarily used to guide field assessments and maximize efficiency in ground truthing data inputs and model outputs, while providing a secondary purpose to evaluate the relative key habitat gains of confirmed barriers in the watershed. This process, combined with input from local knowledge holders and experts, is used to develop field plans for assessing barriers that have the potential to block the most key habitat in the watershed. Field assessments are based on the BC Fish Passage Strategic Approach and can include a barrier assessment (i.e., evaluating passability of the structure), a habitat confirmation (i.e., evaluation of whether the upstream habitat is suitable for the focal species and whether there are other undocumented anthropogenic or natural barriers upstream or downstream), or a detailed habitat investigation (e.g., a fish passage study or further in-depth analysis of habitat features in a waterbody). The ranking process accounts for the long-term and immediate potential habitat gains potentially offered by each structure to identify structures that maximize long-term and immediate potential to improve key habitat connectivity in the watershed. All structures in the watershed (excluding those confirmed as passable) are ranked in each iteration of the ranking process. Details of the ranking process used to guide field assessments can be found in Appendix XX.",

    "text": "Structure Prioritization Summary\nFollowing field assessments, structures are placed on one of five possible lists:\n\nPriority barriers list – the structure is confirmed as a full or partial barrier, has key habitat confirmed to exist upstream, and is considered actionable by the planning team (i.e., action items will be identified to advance rehabilitation of the structure). Depending on the barrier, owner, financial constraints, and quality of upstream habitat, the action may be to leave to end of life cycle before reviewing again, remove and decommission the road, replace with a new passable structure, or modify to temporarily restore connectivity (e.g., fish ladder or baffles installed; Table XX).\nAssessed structures that remain data deficient list – some form of field assessment has been completed on the structure, but further investigation is required to confirm either the passability status or presence/suitability of upstream habitat (TABLEXX).\nRehabilitated barriers list – priority barriers that have been addressed (either through removal, replacement, or temporary fish passage improvement projects; Table XX)\nNon-actionable barriers list – the structure is confirmed to be a barrier to fish passage and have some amount/quality of habitat upstream, but the planning team will not identify actions to advance rehabilitation of the structure because of logistic considerations (e.g., financial costs), short habitat gain, or the upstream habitat is of poor quality or unsuitable in its present condition to support key life stages of the focal species (Appendix XX).\nExcluded structures list – the structure is excluded from further consideration in subsequent ranking and work planning because the structure is confirmed passable (e.g., bridge), not present, or there is no key habitat upstream (Appendix XX).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Confirmed barriers\n\n\nbarrier_idmodelled_crossing_idwatercourse_nameroad_namestructure_typepartial_passabilitystructure_ownernum_barriers_settotal_hab_gain_setupstream_habitat_qualityestimated_cost_$next_stepsreasonnotessupporting_links1233771800404Thompson CreekWalcott RoadStream crossing - CBSYesMOTI11.71High750000Commission engineering designsMOTI already designing new structurePreliminary designs completed but under review for improved design by MOTIhttps://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/thompson-creek---198066-123377-123375---appendix.html1234451800114Tyhee CreekHighway 16Stream crossing - CBSUnknownMOTI28.34Medium1200000Commission engineering designsImportant connector to Tyhee LakePreliminary designs complete and include habitat restoration compoents.

After assessing the potential barriers on the first iteration of the intermediate list (during 2021 field season) and either identifying them as remediation priorities or eliminating them from consideration (e.g., because they passed fish or did hot have suitable habitat upstream), the remaining potential barriers in the watershed were re-prioritized. The barriers on this list were prioritized to exceed the connectivity goals of the plan. Barriers highlighted in the same colour represent sets of barriers that have been prioritized as a group.

This crossing was replaced with a clearspan bridge and opens up approximately 200 m of seasonal off-channel habitat for salmonids during periods of high flow. The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure has been working with local partners to advance designs for barriers on Trib to Buck Creek, Helps Creek, Thompson Creek and Gramophone Creek. The Office of the Wet’suwet’en has hired a part-time staff to help with fish passage coordination in the Bulkley watershed. In addition, efforts have been made by CWF and local partners to build a campaign around Station Creek, to convince the BC government to invest in an appropriate crossing at Highway 16.",
