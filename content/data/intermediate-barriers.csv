198066 (1001802488),Thompson Cr,Resource road crossing,Habitat confirmation,P,0,2.38,2.39,"Consider re-routing stream to the north downstream of crossing, continue to monitor passage.",Appears passable for all life stages and species but may present slight barrier during high flows. Landowners adjacent to the stream report that the channel was historically relocated through the fields near the river and they would like to work together to relocate.
198048 (1001800048),Cesford Creek,Highway crossing,Habitat confirmation,B,1,0.67,0.68,Monitor for fish passage once downstream railway crossing (198090) is remediated.,"Two culverts, fish observed upstream. "
198090,Cesford Creek,Railway,Barrier Assessment,B,0,2.36,2.36,Work with CN to identify crossing location and status.,No crossing located in the field . Possibly an older culvert that has become blocked and buried in sediment over time.
123446,Tyhee Creek,Demographic road crossing,Habitat confirmation,P,1,0,11.37,Monitor for passage once downstream barrier (123445) is replaced.,"Scored as barrier, but likely passable for most fish and life stages. "
58158,McDowell Creek,Highway crossing,Assessed,B,1,0,0.3,Continue to monitor fish passage at this location.,Newly replaced. Baffled and embedded closed-bottom structure with natural substrates. Steep gradient (5.5%) and perched 0.36 cm. Likely not a barrier for most adults and flows.
57944,Toboggan Creek,Highway crossing,Habitat confirmation,P,0,13.43,24.95,Monitor existing passage for continued functionality; aim for replacement at end of culvert life.,Massive closed-bottom structure. Past backwatering work conducted. Pink salmon present at fences upstream in 2021. High quality habitat with moderate cover. 
-1001800355,Ailport Creek,Highway crossing,Habitat confirmation,P,197976,0.4,0.4,Monitor during migration to determine extent of barrier.,"Scores as barrier, but not likely an issue for any life stage except potentially at high flows. Observed juvenile sized fish swimming through crossing (~140 mm). "
197967 (1001800050),Taman Creek/Bulkley River,Highway crossing,Habitat confirmation,B,0,5.2,16.73,Monitor new crossing for passage.,"Replaced by MOTI, confirmed to be passable to fish. Dry at time of assessment with wetland-type area upstream. Unlikely to support salmon."
123770,John Brown Creek,Highway crossing,Habitat confirmation,P,0,11.71,15.88,Monitor during migration to determine efficacy of fish passage.,"Very large system. Dolly Varden, Rainbow Trout, and Coho captured upstream indicating partial barrier only. Chinook utilize reach above the culvert for spawning. Some baffles in culvert. Somewhat steep gradients downstream of crossing."
197663,Johnny David Creek,Highway crossing,Habitat confirmation,P,0,10.28,14.01,Monitor to confirm continued functionality of fish passage; look at open-bottom replacement as long-term fix.,Good candidate for permanent fix and may align with maintenance requirements for the site (inlet is damaged). Backwatering conducted by WFN and LGL in ~2017. Coho upstream and downstream.
198065 (1001800191),Watson Creek,Demographic road crossing,Assess 1001800255 ed,B,1,0,0.99,Reassess following exam of Hwy 16 crossing (197974).,"Very low flow, but channel is mostly watered. Abundant gravels and excellent vegetation cover."
197974 (1001800356),Watson Creek,Highway crossing,Assessed,B,0,0,1.98,"Reassess during higher flows, inspect dam upstream.",Presumed low quality habitat but needs reassessment during higher flows.
