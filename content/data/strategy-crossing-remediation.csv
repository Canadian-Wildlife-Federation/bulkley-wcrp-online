1.1,Remove and decommission barriers,"This action represents some projects that would be led by the planning team with conservation funds (e.g., orphaned barriers or those owned by individuals), while other restoration projects would be the responsibility of the barrier owner. Industry will have to be engaged to successfully implement this intervention.",Medium,Very high,Need more information
1.2,Upgrade and resize crossings,"Examples include installing larger culverts, replacing closed- with open-bottom culverts, or upgrading from culverts to bridges. Important to engage with the agriculture community for some crossing upgrades.",Medium,Very high,Need more information
1.3,Install temporary mitigation,"Examples may include installing fish ladders on barriers that cannot be rehabilitated; however, temporary mitigation does not replace the need for barrier rehabilitation and removal. There are specific cases where temporary fixes are appropriate, but we will focus on long-term solutions wherever possible.",High,High,Effective
1.4,Raise funds to rehabilitate barriers,See “Funding Sources” for more information. Consider inviting potential funders to a fundraising sub-committee.,High,Very high,Effective
1.5,Request regulatory action for non-compliant crossings,"Request provincial and/or federal agencies to require that targeted, high-priority barriers be remediated. This should be a last resort after working to engage barrier owners and ground-truthing the situation. It will be important to identify obstacles to applying compliance and enforcement measures in order to provide the appropriate information on these opportunities.  For example, advocating for increased discretionary decisions to remove barriers to fish. One action could be to submit barrier assessment data to show proof that regulations are not being followed.",Very high,Medium,Need more information
1.6,Engage with CN to address their barriers,"Build relationships with CN to open a two-way discussion on the scale, priority and impact to their business of barrier remediation. Include the financial and ecological cost/benefits of remediation options, with emphasis on the financial. This could start as a letter from both First Nations to show that each community, elected chief, and hereditary house sees this as an issue that needs to be resolved.",Very high,Medium,Need more information
1.7,Knowledge Gap: Continue updating the structure prioritization model,The model has been updated to reflect 2021 field assessments and intermediate barrier review.  ,Very high,Very high,Very effective
1.8,Knowledge Gap: Adapt the provincial fish passage framework to account for adult fish and low-flow conditions,,Very high,Medium,Need more information
1.9,Knowledge Gap: Assess barriers by applying adapted version of the provincial fish passage framework,"The first three steps are, (1) barrier assessments, (2) habitat confirmations, and (3) remediation designs. Barrier assessment data should be captured in the PSCIS database, which is available to all partners. 85 field assessments were performed in 2021.",Medium,High,Need more information
